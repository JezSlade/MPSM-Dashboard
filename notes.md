### Notes
Todo
- Panel Alert Messages
- /CustomerDashboard/Devices maybe returns all customer devices
- dashboard shows devices with alerts only
- many of the APIs will need to work together, get data from 1 API use that data to retreive data from a seperate API
- POST /device/get Returns all data on a specific device based on "Id": "string"
-UI Select Customer > Device List (Prioritize errors) Clickable > Device Details (multiple API calls maybe)
