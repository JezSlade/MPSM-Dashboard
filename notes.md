How to connect
1 - Register your application
Access the developer section of the portal and create the APP credentials.

2- Get the authentication token
In order to obtain a valid access token, you must perform a x-www-form-urlencoded POST to our /token endpoint, passing the following parameters:

    client_id: the client identifier we gave you in the step 1
    client_secret: the client password we gave you in the step 1
    grant_type: fixed value to password
    username: the identifier of the user that wants to login
    password: the password\token of the user that wants to login
    scope: the type of MPS access level(account)

Please note that the access token has an expiration and you should refresh it before that happens (see step 4) or you must perform this step again.
