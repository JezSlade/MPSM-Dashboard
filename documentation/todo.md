# ToDo

- Card Pagination default setting adjustable from settings.
- Standardize Tables
- Pull ALL API data, store it all locally in a massive spreadsheet or persistent memory of some time maybe json? 
- Engine is mostly stable, still ironing it out. Will need to wire up cards to it to get cached API data instead of pulling every time.
