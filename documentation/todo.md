Allow altering default settings in settings (What widgets load by default) I'd like to remove a widget entirely, but it loads by default and I keep having to change the default Title, and I'd like to be able to choose my own icons, can you give a menu of icons to choose from for both widgets and Title?

IDE built into widget settings that opens the widget source code in a new tab. maintain styling. I am aware of the security risks and this is a controlled environment. To recap: the widget settings will have an IDE button that will open the Widget's source code (php file) in a stylish looking IDE in a new tab. Add functionality to save etc.
