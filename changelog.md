# ChangeLog

Updated API Integration (Token Management) â€“ Mar 28, 2025: Revised the MPSM Dashboard API integration script (working_token.py) to use a base URL from the .env file. The script now constructs full endpoint URLs by appending paths (e.g., /token, /GetPrinters, /GetAlerts) to the BASE_URL defined in .env, instead of requiring full URLs for each endpoint. This change centralizes the API base URL configuration, so switching environments or endpoints no longer requires editing multiple .env entries. Existing authentication logic (token acquisition and refresh using client credentials) and header usage is maintained. The .env file remains required for configuration (containing BASE_URL, credentials, etc.), and the code is restructured for clarity and modularity, with thorough inline comments explaining each step.
